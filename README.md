# Kheti_Seva
The KhetiSeva app is a mobile application built with flutter for farmers that provides an interactive and 
informational viewpoint to farmers. The app is designed to be easy to use and filled with 
features that can help farmers to improve the productivity of their land as well as access useful 
information to help them make informed decisions in addition to using it for their gains.

KhetiSeva is filled with various features, one of which is to help farmers scan their crops to 
identify diseases and provide appropriate remedies. Often, farmers can recognize when their 
crops are damaged or infected, but they may lack knowledge about how to effectively address 
the issue, resulting in the complete removal of the crop. With this feature, farmers can identify 
the specific disease affecting their crops and access the necessary remedies, enabling them to 
optimize plant health and prolong the crop's lifespan.

Furthermore, the app also educates farmers about various cropping methods that can enhance 
sustainability and increase yield. By providing valuable insights and guidance, the app 
empowers farmers to adopt best practices for crop cultivation. These methods may include 
techniques such as crop rotation, intercropping, organic farming, precision agriculture, and 
water conservation practices. By promoting sustainable farming practices and sharing 
knowledge, the app aims to assist farmers in maximizing their crop productivity while 
minimizing environmental impact.
