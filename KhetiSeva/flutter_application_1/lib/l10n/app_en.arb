  "crp": "Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area across a sequence of growing seasons. It reduces reliance on one set of nutrients, pest and weed pressure, and the probability of developing resistant pests and weeds.",
  "name": "Green manures are crops grown within a rotation for the purposes of: building soil organic matter and soil structure. supplying nitrogen and other nutrients for a following crop. preventing leaching of soluble nutrients from the soil.",
  "nameHint": "Biological control is the use of living organisms to suppress pest populations, making them less damaging than they would otherwise be. Natural enemies of insects play an important role in limiting the densities of potential pests. These natural enemies include predators, parasitoids, and pathogens.",
  "email": "Agricultural farms have useful and harmful organisms that affect the fields. The growth of organisms needs to be controlled to save crops and soil. In this process natural or less chemicals, herbicides and pesticides are used to protect soil and crops. Controlling other organisms requires proper maintenance throughout the area.",
  "emailHint": "Earlier, monoculture was the practice of growing only one type of crop in agricultural fields and cultivating it in a specific area. However, in the recent world, polyculture has come into the picture to grow and cultivate different types of crops to meet the increasing crop demand and to produce essential soil microorganisms.",
  "dateOfBirth": "A weed, in simple words, is nothing but an unwanted plant growing in agricultural fields. However, in organic farming, more attention is paid to suppressing weeds rather than eliminating them completely. Two of the most widely used weed management techniques are: Mulching – the process of using plastic films to prevent weed growth, mowing and cutting – in which the top growth of weeds is removed.",
  "requiredField": " After the season of cultivation has been conducted, the soil loses its nutrients and becomes less in quality. Rather than using harmful chemicals to enhance this soil, organic agriculture focuses on implementing natural ways to not only increase the health of soil but also keep the nature and human health unharmed. One of the best examples of natural ways to enhance soil is the use of bacteria that is present in animal waste. This bacteria help in making the soil nutrients more productive; much higher as compared to the chemical containing liquids.",
  "submitInfo": "Rich in nutrients, it is recycled organic material used as fertilizer in agricultural fields, which is the reason for the implementation of organic farming in many countries, which reduces the use of various harmful chemicals that can have dangerous effects on crops in the field. Here, there is a greater focus on using natural means to improve the quality of soil and cultivated crops. Organic farming is nothing but modernization in agriculture. It is a combination of science, technology and nature.",
  "aboutUs": " Since organic agriculture encourages the use of natural ways to enhance the farm, crops and soil; there is a discouragement of genetically engineered animals and plants. Hence, genetic modification is kept out of this agriculture. However, there is an argument keeping in mind that the pollen present in such modified crops are present in the stock of seeds used for organic agriculture, making it impossible to keep this completely out of this agriculture.",

  "about": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
